# CaseStudy

##  Task 1:   

Imagine you are a Data Engineer in BMW's Supply Chain Delivery Assurance department. One of the Supply Chain Managers who is using your Dashboards mentioned that they want additional information displayed about BMWâ€™s suppliers. Especially external factors such as political stability and weather are increasingly important. Describe an approach to solve this problem.   

You should touch on the following points:  

    1. How would you approach this problem in general? What are the critical aspects to solve it?  

    2. Where do you get the data from?  

    3. What technology would you use to extract the data?  

    4. How would you store the data? Sketch out a database design as well as a cloud architecture  

    5. What pipelines would you build to make use of the data that you have chosen in step 1.  

    6. Sketch how you would visualize the data on a dashboard.   

   

## Task 2:   

A) Imagine you work in a Crypto Startup and you want to identify malicious Ethereum addresses. Fortunately, you have found a source with malicious addresses. You can find it here: https://github.com/kstyppaBMW/CaseStudy/blob/main/malicious_adresses

    1) Create a list of the malicious addresses 

 

B) Your idea now is to use this list of malicious Ethereum addresses to understand how malicious people behave in the blockchain. Therefore, you use the list of addresses to extract data about their behavior out of Etherscan (Hint: This is where you need to look. https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts#get-a-list-of-normal-transactions-by-address) 

    2) Download data about the transaction of the malicious addresses. 

    3) Create a set of useful features that describe the behavior of the malicious address within the blockchain (e.g. avg. amount of ETH sent per transaction). 

 

C) After successfully creating a data set that contains features describing an address's blockchain behavior, you are ready to analyze their behavior.  

    1) Analyze the addresses' behavior. What helpful statements can you make?  

    2) Group the addresses in several categories based on their behavior. Justify your grouping decision. 

    3) Given the different groups you have created, what would you advise the business to do?  

    4) Besides grouping the addresses, what kind of additional analysis might be helpful for the business? Sketch out your ideas.
